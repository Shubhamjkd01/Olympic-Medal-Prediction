## Project Overview

This project predicts how many medals a country may win in the Olympics using machine learning. 
As a beginner in AI/ML, I worked with historical Olympic data and followed the complete ML workflow—starting from forming a hypothesis, exploring data, selecting features, training a model, and finally evaluating it. 
This project helped me understand the basics of building an end-to-end ML project using Python and goggle collab 
## Project Steps

Most machine learning projects follow a common workflow.  
In this project, I followed the same steps to build my Olympic medal prediction model.  
These steps are useful for solving almost any ML problem:

1. **Form a hypothesis** – Decide what you want to predict and why.
2. **Explore the dataset** – Understand the structure, features, and any missing values.
3. **Reshape or prepare the data** (if needed) – Modify or select columns to match the prediction target.
4. **Clean the data** – Handle missing values and remove unnecessary features.
5. **Choose an error metric** – Decide how to measure model performance (MAE, R², etc.).
6. **Split the dataset** – Create training and testing sets for model evaluation.
7. **Train the model** – Fit a machine learning algorithm (Linear Regression in this project).
8. **Evaluate the results** – Compare predicted values with actual values to understand performance.

## Code and File Overview

This repository contains the complete code for my Olympic Medal Prediction machine learning project. 
The project is organized into clear Jupyter/Colab notebooks to make the workflow easy to understand.
