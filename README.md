## Project Overview

This project predicts how many medals a country may win in the Olympics using machine learning. 
As a beginner in AI/ML, I worked with historical Olympic data and followed the complete ML workflow—starting from forming a hypothesis, exploring data, selecting features, training a model, and finally evaluating it. 
This project helped me understand the basics of building an end-to-end ML project using Python and goggle collab 
## Project Steps

Most machine learning projects follow a common workflow.  
In this project, I followed the same steps to build my Olympic medal prediction model.  
These steps are useful for solving almost any ML problem:

1. #Form a hypothesis.
2 #(If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4 #Clean the data for ML.
5  #Pick an error metric.
6  #Split your data.
7  #Train a model.

## Code and File Overview

This repository contains the complete code for my Olympic Medal Prediction machine learning project. 
The project is organized into clear Jupyter/Colab notebooks to make the workflow easy to understand.
You can find the code for this project here[click here ](https://github.com/Shubhamjkd01/Olympic-Medal-Prediction/blob/main/olympic-medal-prediction.ipynb)


### 🗂 Data Files
- **teams.csv** — Team-level dataset used to train the model.
- **athlete_events.csv** — (Optional) Athlete-level dataset used for generating team-level features.
We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on  Kaggle [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
All code is written in Python and can be run in both Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Project Steps

In this project, I followed the same steps to build my Olympic medal prediction model.  
These steps are helpful for solving almost any ML problem:

1. **Form a hypothesis**  
2. **Explore the dataset**  
3. **Reshape the data (if necessary)** to match the prediction target  
4. **Clean the data** for ML (missing values, removing unused columns, etc.)  
5. **Pick an error metric** (MAE, R² score, etc.)  
6. **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets  
7. **Train a machine learning model** (Linear Regression in this project)  
8. **Evaluate the model** using appropriate metrics

## 📂 Data Files

- **teams.csv** — Team-level dataset used to train the model  
- **athlete_events.csv** (optional) — Athlete-level dataset used to generate additional features  

The dataset was originally made available on Kaggle:  
🔗 [120 Years of Olympic History — Athletes and Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

All code is written in **Python** and can be run using **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
